    steps:
    # 1. Checkout the code from the repository
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # 2. Setup .NET 8 SDK
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
      with:

    # 3. Restore Dependencies
    # Gate 1: Fails if NuGet packages are missing or incompatible
    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore ./WorkoutService/WorkoutService.csproj

    # 4. Build (Compilation)
    # Gate 2: Fails on Syntax Errors (e.g., missing semicolon) or compilation issues
    # If this fails, the pipeline STOPS here 🛑
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release ./WorkoutService/WorkoutService.csproj

    # 5. Run Tests (Optional - Currently Commented Out)
    # Gate 3: Fails if any Unit Test fails (Logic Bugs)
    # Note: Uncomment when you add a Test Project
    # - name: Test
    #   run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal ./WorkoutService.Tests/WorkoutService.Tests.csproj

    # 6. Docker Build (The Final Reward)
    # This step ONLY executes if all previous steps (Restore, Build, Test) succeeded ✅
